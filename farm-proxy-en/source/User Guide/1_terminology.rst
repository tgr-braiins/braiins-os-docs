Braiins Farm proxy is a software application that accepts hashrate through multiple listening ports **Servers** [#f1]_ transferring it to the multiple endpoints **Targets** by following defined rules **Routing goals**. Targets are referred to a list of endpoints **Routing goal levels**. A collection of Servers, Routing goals and Routing goal levels is referred to as the **Routing domain**.

Connections from miners to the Braiins Farm Proxy are referred to as **Downstream** connections. Connections from Braiins Farm Proxy to a mining pool are referred to as **Upstream** connections.

Used Terminology is put into context with use of following diagrams.
